# test-pre-commit.sh — proves .githooks/pre-commit actually blocks, rather than
# assuming it does.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: in a sibling repo this gate was ported from, the hook's
# first version used a grep pipeline that errored out under ugrep (this machine's `grep`)
# and, with `|| true` swallowing the error, exited 0 on a staged diff containing a live
# corporate email address. It looked installed and correct and guarded nothing. A leak
# guard is only worth having if something checks it — and an untested one is worse than
# none, because it is trusted.
#
# Every string below is synthetic. The identity-specific patterns the real hook also
# loads are deliberately NOT in this repo (see the hook's header), so this script tests
# the *loading mechanism* with a throwaway pattern file and a canary string instead —
# which proves the private half works without publishing any of it.
#
# Run from the repo root:  .githooks/test-pre-commit.sh
# Exits 0 only if every case behaves as expected.

# A commit can fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the hook — a broken
# scratch repo, a missing mktemp, a git that would not run. Counting any failure
# as "blocked" is the same fail-open the hook itself once had, one level up. So a
# block only counts if the scanner said so in its own words.
#
# The marker is the BLOCKED banner *with its scope*, and two earlier versions of
# it were both too loose:
#
#   "leak check:"          — also printed by the SUCCESS path's "generic patterns
#                            only" warning and by the pattern-file abort messages,
#                            so any unrelated crash that printed it satisfied
#                            should_block() with nothing detected.
#   "leak check: BLOCKED"  — narrower, but identical for both hooks, so a case
#                            asserting the staged-content gate fired was equally
#                            satisfied by the commit-MESSAGE gate firing on a
#                            fixture carrying the same string in both places.
#
# Each gate now names itself, and each case asserts the specific one. The two
# abort paths carry their own EXPECT_MARKER rather than loosening these.
# `test_scope_markers_are_distinguishable` below reproduces the false pass and
# fails if it ever returns.
